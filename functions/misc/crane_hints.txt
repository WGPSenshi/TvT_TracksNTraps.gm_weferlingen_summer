gm_bpz2a1_hook == invisible when spawning?!
gm_bpz2_hook_base

crane_hook_axis
crane_hook == menmpoint for attachTo of hook

its all setup to work, but due to limitations not DLC worthy
so its "hidden" away
can see to making it available via a variable or editor modul of some kind

I thik the hook can be createVehicle'd?
yes

its 100% wierd scripting hacks
especialy since ropes cannot be conencted directly to a bone that is animated without causing a CTD :smile:

You can find it via the config explorer. gm_bpz2a1_hook

isnt there a memorypoint on the crane for ropes?
GalComT — 30.10.2020
there is
Tobi — 30.10.2020
is that connected to the bone for the animation?
GalComT — 30.10.2020
those memorypoints are for a dummy object
which is attached to the crane
to which then the ropes are atatched :smile:
lol
and tada no ctd
